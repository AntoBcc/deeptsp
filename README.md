# Informed Machine Learning for the Travelling Salesman Problem: Belief Propagation (Part 1)

*This work is geared towards a MSc research thesis, for the MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics ([DSBA](http://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/master+of+science/data+science+and+business+analytics)) at Bocconi University. It has been developed with the support and supervision of prof. [CarloLucibello](https://github.com/CarloLucibello).*

Implementation of a belief propagation algorithm for minimum-weight perfect 2-matching, in order to use the resulting approximation as a source of prior information for a *graph neural network*, to approximately solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP). 

Convergence diagnostics and overlap with the TSP solutions available in `test/`.
Data was generated by the **Concorde TSP solver**, using [this script](https://github.com/AntoBcc/benchmarking-gnns/blob/master/data/TSP/generate_TSP.py).

## Instructions

To create and use the virtual environment (same needed for the GNN part of the project)
```
#if the environment has not been created yet
conda env create -f deeptsp.yml -n deeptsp

#once created
conda activate deeptsp
```

To run BP experiments on tsp30-50:

```
# At the root of the project
bash run.sh
```

The bash script relies on
```
src/run_BP.py
src/BP.py
```
